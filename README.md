Deploy this codebase to Casa to deploy a fastapi app to the cloud and run a workflow on a schedule. 

This app is a great starting point for a ML training pipeline and serving application, and with documentation built right in, Casa is the best place for you and your team to start building and shipping software.

To get started, clone this repository, and push it to your codebase in Casa. Follow the steps below!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/casadotdev/preview-env-python-demo.git && cd preview-env-python-demo
git remote remove origin && git remote add origin https://casa.dev/YOUR_TEAM_NAME/preview-env-python-demo.git
git push origin main
```

After that, you should see the app deploy and the workflow run momentarily.
