You can start writing a new doc by clicking "**Write**" above, or by cloning the codebase and adding a new doc to the `.casa/docs` directory. If you're writing in the editor, save your changes to your doc by clicking "**Save**".

### Writing code 🤖

When it comes to writing code, you can use whatever editor you like to start writing.

You can also use casa's code editor to suggest changes, do code review, and ship changes! Just select a file to get started.

To get started pushing code from your local computer, get your token for cloning this repository here: [https://casa.dev/profile](https://casa.dev/profile).

Once you've got your token, enter it when you're prompted when you run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://casa.dev/casa/preview-env-python-demo.git && cd preview-env-python-demo
```

Then write whatever code you like and push it back up to casa like so:

```bash
git push origin main
```
